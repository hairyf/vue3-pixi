# Animated Transition

vue3-pixi provides out-of-the-box transition effects. You can use the `Transition` component on any element, which inherits from Vue's `<BaseTransition>`.

The usage of `AnimatedTransition` is similar to [Vue Transition](https://cn.vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html#javascript-hooks) (but does not include CSS modes). The component can wrap any element, and the transition effect is triggered when the `v-if` condition of the element becomes `true|false`. It can also be encapsulated as a standalone transition component.

> It is important to note that the default Transition component cannot be overridden, so the exported component name is `AnimatedTransition`.

## Usage

Pixi.js does not provide a built-in tweening engine, but you can use third-party tweening engines like `GSAP` or `Tween.js` to achieve tween animations.

<demo src="./demo/transition.vue" :width="400" :expand="false" />

## Properties Mode

Unlike the Vue Transition, you can achieve transition effects by setting different properties:

<demo src="./demo/transition-properties.vue" :width="400" />

## Ease

By default, all transition effects are linear. You can customize the transition easing by using custom cubic-bezier curves.

## Ease Presets

The following transitions are available via the `TransitionPresets` constant.

For more complex transitions, a custom function can be provided.

## Ticker

You can also control the transition effects by setting enter and level to functions:
